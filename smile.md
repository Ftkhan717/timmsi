# SMILE Methodâ„¢ with Timmsi
We encourage learning from preschool all the way to career growth with a SMILE - a Self-Motivated Impact Learning Environment. In this method, students go through a 5-step process to encourage themselves, ignite their own curiosity, find inner passions, collaborate with like-minded individuals who share similar goals and who are discovering the same subjects, and finally to engage in community development to share wisdom back with those who need it most.

We have trained the same individuals for over 25 years and continue to encourage, inspire, and mentor curious minds of all ages. We curate learning environments to be peaceful, flexible, and all-encompassing with tools in place for the self-motivated to explore. Nobody wants to sit in small desks and get lectured, but on the flipside - teachers do not want to work with students who lack motivation. As a SMILE Student, you are responsible for your own exploration and your own curiosity.

The Curiosity Coach does not hold your hand through the learning process, but instead reminds you how valuable it is to make mistakes and also reminds you to engage in impactful learning. This style of learning has tangible results in your community instead of mundane homework with no real-world application. In this fashion, we are able to give internships and opportunities to students of all levels within companies and organizations who are partnered with us.
