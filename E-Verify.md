## E-Verify:

* E-Verify is an internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.

* 🌎 It is important to note that this system is only for use in the United States and cannot be used to verify the eligibility of employees who are not authorized to 
  work in the United States.

* 💻 E-Verify web services allow businesses to verify the employment eligibility of their employees through an automated system that provides real-time feedback on the
  employee's status.

* 🤖 This automated system helps businesses ensure that they are in compliance with all federal immigration laws and regulations.

* 🤓 To get started with E-Verify web services, you will need to sign up for an account on the official E-Verify website.

* 👋 Once you have an account, you can begin using the system to verify the eligibility of your employees and interns.

## ICA ( iNTERFACE CONTROL AGREEMENT ):

* The ICA is a legally binding contract that establishes the terms and conditions of the employer's use of the E-Verify web services. It contains technical specifications
and guidelines that are necessary for the employer's software to communicate with the E-Verify system.

* By signing the ICA, the employer agrees to follow all applicable laws, rules, and policies related to E-Verify use, and to protect the security and confidentiality of 
E-Verify data.

* The ICA ensures that the employer's software interface is compatible with E-Verify and that the employer is aware of and complying with E-Verify program 
  requirements.

## E-Verify Cases:

* When we're talking about E-Verify, the term "Case" refers to the electronic record that is created when an employer submits an employee's Form I-9 information to 
  E-Verify for employment eligibility verification.

* 🤓Just to give you a bit more context, E-Verify is an online system that is used by employers to verify the employment eligibility of newly hired employees.

* 🧐If the information provided by the employee matches government records, E-Verify will return a "Confirmation" result. If there is a mismatch, E-Verify will return
  a "Tentative Non-Confirmation (TNC)" result, and the employer and employee will be prompted to take steps to resolve the discrepancy.

* 👍🏼In either case, a "Case" is created in E-Verify to document the verification process and the results.
